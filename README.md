# CV_Midterm
This is the midterm assignment of DATA130051 Computer Vision.

In the first part of the project, we use several CNNs to build classifiers for CIFAR-
100, and try to use some augmentation methods like cutmix, cutout, and mixup
to improve the modelâ€™s accuracy. And we finally get a top-1 accuracy of 83.01%
and top-5 accuracy of 95.70% using the WideResNet-28. 

In the second part of
the project, we train VOC 2007 using Faster R-CNN and YOLO v3, by the help
of pretrained models, we finally gain the mAP0.5 of 77.44% and 86.83% respectively,
we also test both models on several images that do not belong to the VOC
dataset and get promising results.

The usage of the codes like training and testing processes are shown in 
the corresponding folder.
